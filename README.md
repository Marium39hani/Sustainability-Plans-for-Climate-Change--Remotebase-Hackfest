A changing climate is leading to more occurrences of extreme events such as droughts (moisture deficits) and floods (moisture surpluses), which have a negative impact on crop growth and yields.

SOLUTION
Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries
Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning
Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning
Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing.
